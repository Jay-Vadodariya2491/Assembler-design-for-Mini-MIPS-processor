#Assembler design for Mini-MIPS processor
The MIPS architecture, a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture created by MIPS Computer Systems, a branch of Imagination Technologies, is streamlined into MiniMIPS.
An assembler made especially for MIPS architecture is called MIPSASM. It supports directives and macros together with the MIPS I, II, III, and IV instruction sets.It provides good performance and is generally
optimized for MIPS architectures. Compared to GAS, the interface may be easier for novices to use, particularly for those who are primarily interested in MIPS architecture.
Our assemble is able to execute verious assembley instructions like add, sub, nand, nor, sll, bez, bnez, bgez, blez, bgtz, bltz, lw, sw etc.
